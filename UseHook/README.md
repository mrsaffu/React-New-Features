# ðŸ”„ React 19 â€“ `use()` Hook Example

Welcome to the **React 19 `use()` Hook** demo!  
This folder explains and demonstrates how to use the new `use()` hook introduced in React 19, using a simple and clear example.

---

## ðŸ“˜ What is the `use()` Hook?

The `use()` hook is a new feature in React 19 that lets you **use asynchronous data directly inside a component**â€”without needing extra state or effect hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

### âœ… Why is it useful?

Before `use()`, to fetch data in a component, you'd have to:
1. Set up a state with `useState`
2. Fetch data in `useEffect`
3. Handle loading and error states manually

Now, with `use()`, you can **simply call a promise** and wait for it right inside your componentâ€”less code and more readable!

## âœ¨ How it works

Hereâ€™s what `use()` does:

- Accepts a **promise** (like `fetch()` or an async function).
- Suspends the component until the promise is resolved.
- Automatically triggers React Suspense fallback (if needed).
